        <h2>Our Lore</h2>
        
        <p> Once upon a time, in a tiny kitchen that looked more like a bakery experiment gone wild, a brilliant yet slightly chaotic cookie lover named Ali had a dream. 🛌✨ The dream wasn’t about saving the world or inventing the next big app—it was about cookies. But not just *any* cookies. Ali wanted to create cookies so good, so ridiculously skibidi, that they’d make people laugh, cry, and maybe even do a little happy dance in their kitchen. 🕺🍪 It all started on a rainy Tuesday. 🌧️ Ali was baking, as always, but something wasn’t right. The cookies were... okay. Just okay. “Okay?!” Ali thought. “That’s not good enough! People deserve cookies that make them<b>TREMBLE</b>  with joy!” And that’s how <b>Tremble Cookies</b> was born—a cookie revolution, a baked rebellion against mediocrity. 🎉At <b>Tremble Cookies</b>, it’s not just about treats; it’s about the whole vibe. ✨ Imagine this: you’re having a rough day. Your boss just emailed you—again—asking for something you already sent. 🙄 Your phone is at 5%. 📱⚠️ And then you remember. There’s a box of Tremble Cookies waiting for you at home. 🍪✨ The second you take that first bite, everything changes. The world slows down. A choir of angels starts singing. 🎶 Your taste buds throw a party, and suddenly, all is right in the universe. 🌈 That’s the power of a Tremble Cookie. Yes, we’re 100% serious about these cookies. (Well, 98% serious, because we also like to joke around. 😜) Our cookies are so skibidi—that’s internet slang for ridiculously amazing, by the way—that they’ll have you trembling with joy. We’re not just here to feed you cookies; we’re here to give you a moment. A moment of pure, unfiltered happiness that hits you like a warm hug and a high-five all at once. 🤗✋ Our kitchen isn’t just a kitchen; it’s a **cookie lab**. 🧪 This is where the magic happens, where dough meets dreams. We experiment with everything—classic flavors like gooey chocolate chip 🍫, wild ideas like cookies stuffed with mini donuts 🍩, and seasonal specials like pumpkin spice 🎃, peppermint mocha ❄️, and even mango madness 🌞. And yes, sometimes, we push boundaries a little too far. One time, we tried to make a cookie that sparkles like a unicorn. ✨ It didn’t work—we’re still finding glitter everywhere—but you can’t say we didn’t try.We’d love to tell you it was all smooth sailing, but there were... incidents. 🚨 Like the time Jamie accidentally doubled the baking powder in a batch. What should’ve been cookies turned into cookie volcanos that exploded all over the oven. 🍪🌋 The cleanup took *days*, but hey, it was worth it. Lesson learned: baking is an adventure. 🧹 Despite the fails, every cookie we make is crafted with love ❤️, care 🥰, and the best ingredients we can get our hands on. Think buttery dough, velvety chocolate, and the kind of magic that only exists in grandma’s kitchen. 👵✨ We don’t just have customers; we have a cookie squad. 💃 These are the people who tag us on Instagram with their "cookie moments" 📸, send us DMs about how they cried happy tears while eating a Tremble Cookie 😭🍪, and write reviews like, “I’d sell my left sock for another box of these.” 🧦 Real talk: one fan actually said, “These cookies are so good, I forgot my ex's name while eating one.” 💔 Another confessed, “I tried to save some for later but ended up eating the whole box in one sitting. No regrets.” 🤤 We love these stories because they show that Tremble Cookies aren’t just snacks; they’re experiences. ✨Of course, not everything we try works out. 😅 One of our biggest flops was the frosting-filled cookie experiment. 🍥 It sounded amazing in theory—imagine biting into a soft cookie and finding creamy frosting inside—but in reality, the frosting burst out like lava from a volcano. 🌋 Our testers loved the taste but suggested we rename it to "messy deliciousness." We’re still working on that one, but hey, perfection takes time. ⏳ What’s this about “skibidi,” you ask? 🤔 It’s a vibe, a rhythm, a feeling you get when life is too good to handle. Like when you find extra fries at the bottom of the bag 🍟, or when your favorite show drops a surprise season. 📺 That’s how a Tremble Cookie makes you feel: skibidi. We dare you to eat one of our cookies without smiling, dancing, or at least doing a little wiggle in your chair. 💃 Spoiler: it’s impossible. These cookies were made to make you move. 🕺 At Tremble Cookies, we believe life’s too short for boring desserts. 🍰 Whether you’re here to celebrate 🎉, recover from a bad day 🥲, or simply indulge 😌, our cookies are ready to make your day brighter. So go ahead, treat yourself. Grab a box, grab a friend (or don’t—we won’t judge if you keep them all to yourself) 😉, and experience cookie bliss like never before. Remember: cookies aren’t just food; they’re love ❤️, joy 🥳, and happiness 🌈 rolled into one warm, delicious package. And at Tremble Cookies, we’re here to make sure you feel it in every bite. 🍪✨</p>

        <h2>Why we do What We do</h2>
        <p> Why do we do what we do? That’s easy—because cookies make the world a better place. 🍪✨ At Tremble Cookies, we aren’t just in the business of baking desserts; we’re in the business of spreading joy. Every bite you take isn’t just a treat for your taste buds; it’s a burst of happiness, a warm hug, and a moment to savor life. 🥰 Life is busy, chaotic even, but a great cookie can stop time—just for a second—and remind you that the simple things matter most. That’s our mission: to turn dessert into a celebration and prove that cookies are the main course. Period. 🎉But we don’t just wing it; we’ve got standards. Scratch that—we’ve got non-negotiables. 🚨 These are the pillars that guide everything we bake and everything we stand for. They’re not just rules; they’re the very heart of Tremble Cookies. 💓</p>
        <h3>Our Non-Negotiables</h3>
        <ul style="list-style: none;">
            <li><h2>🔥 Freshness Over Everything</h2>
            <p>You know that feeling when you bite into a cookie, and it’s still warm, like it just stepped out of the oven? That’s the vibe we’re all about. 🏠✨ We bake fresh, daily, so every cookie tastes like it was crafted just for you. No sitting around, no cutting corners. Every batch is baked with care, and every bite is a reminder of why freshness matters. 🌟 Your cookies won’t just be delicious—they’ll feel like home.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h2>💖 Love & Care in Every Crumb</h2>
            <p>
                We don’t make cookies for the sake of making cookies. We bake with intention. Each ingredient we use is handpicked, from the creamiest butter to the richest chocolate chips. 🍫🧈 When you eat one of our cookies, you’re tasting love, care, and a sprinkle of magic (and maybe some accidental flour smudges because, hey, we’re human). It’s our little way of saying, “You’re worth it.” Every. Single. Time.
            </p>
             </li>
            <li><h2>🌍 Supporting the Local Fam</h2>
            <p>We believe in community, and that means sourcing ingredients from local suppliers whenever possible. 🛒✨ From farm-fresh eggs to organic sugars, we’re all about lifting up the people around us. When you bite into a Tremble Cookie, you’re not just supporting a bakery; you’re supporting local farms, families, and businesses that make our world go round. 🐄💚 And let’s talk about why these non-negotiables exist. They aren’t just about making cookies—they’re about making your day. Maybe it’s a quick snack between Zoom meetings. 🖥️ Maybe you’re surprising your bestie on their birthday. 🎂 Or maybe you’re just treating yourself because, let’s face it, you deserve it. ✨ Whatever the reason, we’re here to make sure every cookie you eat is unforgettable. At Tremble Cookies, the motto is simple: dessert is life, and cookies are the MVPs. So next time you take a bite of one of our cookies, know that behind that chewy, melty perfection is a promise. 💬 A promise to deliver love, warmth, and the kind of joy that lingers long after the last crumb is gone. ❤️🍪</p>
